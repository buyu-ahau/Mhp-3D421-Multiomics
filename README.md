# Multi-omics analysis of Mhp-infected 3D4/21 cells

This repository contains the analysis scripts and code for the manuscript:
**"Epigenomic mechanisms drive dynamic heterogeneity in 3D4/21 cells infected with Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae"** (或者是你投稿的具体标题)

## Data Availability
The raw sequencing data have been deposited in NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) under accession number **GSEXXXXXX**.

## Analysis Pipeline
The analysis workflow includes:
- **RNA-seq**: Quality control, alignment (HISAT2), quantification (featureCounts), and differential expression (DESeq2).
- **ATAC-seq**: Alignment (BWA-MEM), peak calling (MACS2), and motif analysis (HOMER).
- **CUT&Tag**: Histone modification profiling and integration.
